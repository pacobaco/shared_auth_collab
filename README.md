# 🔁 Shared Auth & Collaboration Module for Multi-User AI Tools

This module provides a plug-and-play multi-user collaboration interface for AI-powered apps. Designed for integration into projects like [pacobaco/neuromart](https://github.com/pacobaco/neuromart), [tpse](https://github.com/pacobaco/tpse), and [tracebar](https://github.com/pacobaco/tracebar), it adds robust team functionality and access control to backend logic, allowing multiple users to securely share sessions, edit collaboratively, and manage permissions.

## 🔌 How to Integrate

In your project’s `app.js`:

```js
const teamRoutes = require('./shared-auth-collab/routes/teamRoutes');
app.use('/api/team', teamRoutes);
```

And attach session-based logic using:

```js
const { requireTeamAccess } = require('./shared-auth-collab/middleware/teamAccess');
app.post('/api/session/:id', requireTeamAccess, sessionController.update);
```
